That’s a very smart question — because in 2025, WhatsApp Channels and Telegram Channels have become serious money-making tools (especially for creators like you who run info-based channels such as Bengali Career 360).

Let’s break it down clearly 👇


---

💰 1️⃣ WhatsApp Channel: Profit Earning Model (2025)

WhatsApp Channels are broadcast-only feeds — perfect for sharing job updates, short videos, or motivational posts.
But WhatsApp doesn’t directly pay you yet like YouTube does — instead, you can earn indirect income in 5 strong ways.


---

🔹 A. Affiliate Marketing

You share links of:

Online courses (Unacademy, Testbook, Adda247, Skillshare)

Amazon / Flipkart job-related products (books, laptops, etc.)


Every time someone buys via your link 👉 you earn a commission (5%–40%).

Example:

You post: “WBPSC Preparation Book 📘 👉 [affiliate link]”

100 people buy = ₹50–₹1000 per product = ₹5000–₹10,000/month easily.



---

🔹 B. Sponsorships

After you get 10K+ followers, local coaching centers or skill institutes will pay you to:

Promote their classes

Post their banner / update


💸 Typical rate: ₹500–₹5,000 per post depending on reach.


---

🔹 C. YouTube Traffic Booster

Use your WhatsApp channel to promote your YouTube videos.
That increases YouTube views → which directly increases your AdSense income.

So it’s an indirect monetization multiplier.


---

🔹 D. Paid Job Updates / Premium Group

You can create a VIP Group (₹49–₹199/month) that gives:

Early access to circulars

Resume help

Exam tips


Even 100 members × ₹99 = ₹9,900/month recurring.


---

🔹 E. Brand Collaboration (Future Feature)

WhatsApp is testing a “creator payment program” in India (Meta Verified creators).
When this launches fully, you’ll get revenue per post view — similar to Telegram.


---

💰 Average Earnings (WhatsApp Channel, India 2025)

Followers	Earnings/month (₹)	Main Source

1K–5K	₹0 – ₹2,000	Affiliate + YouTube traffic
10K–50K	₹5,000 – ₹25,000	Sponsors + Affiliate
100K+	₹25,000 – ₹1L+	Premium posts + multiple sponsors



---

💼 2️⃣ Telegram Channel: Profit Earning Model (2025)

Telegram allows much more monetization freedom — you can earn from ads, subscriptions, bots, and affiliate links.


---

🔹 A. Telegram Ad Platform (TON Revenue)

Telegram launched official ads in public channels (TON blockchain-based).
You get 50% of ad revenue from your channel’s traffic.
💰 Earnings depend on location & views (CPM $0.5–$3 globally).

If your channel has 100K+ subscribers, this can be ₹10,000–₹60,000/month or more.


---

🔹 B. Sponsored Posts

You can post:

> “Bengali PSC Coaching Partner – Sponsored by XYZ Institute”



Typical rate: ₹300–₹2,000 per post (small) → ₹10,000+ for large channels.


---

🔹 C. Affiliate Marketing

Same as WhatsApp: book links, course links, Amazon/Flipkart, etc.

Bonus: Telegram allows buttons & inline links, which increase clicks = more sales.


---

🔹 D. Paid Membership Groups

You can set up a private Telegram group with premium content:

Study materials, PDFs, resume templates, etc.

Access by monthly subscription (via Stripe, Razorpay, or manual payments)


💸 100 members × ₹99 = ₹9,900/month easily.


---

🔹 E. Cross-Promotion

When your Telegram grows, smaller channels will pay you to promote theirs. 💰 ₹500–₹2000 per promo post.


---

💰 Average Earnings (Telegram Channel, India 2025)

Subscribers	Estimated Monthly Earnings (₹)	Income Sources

1K–10K	₹1,000 – ₹5,000	Affiliate + small sponsors
10K–50K	₹5,000 – ₹30,000	Paid posts + Ad revenue
100K+	₹30,000 – ₹1L+	Ads + Sponsors + Premium groups
